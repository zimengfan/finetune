# Fine-Tuning a Pretrained LLM Model

## Introduction

### What is Fine-Tuning?
**Fine-tuning** is the process of taking a pre-trained language model and making it more specialized by training it further on a specific dataset. This allows the model to better understand and respond to the types of queries or tasks relevant to the new data. While preparing the dataset can be challenging, the actual fine-tuning process is relatively straightforward.

## Dataset Collection

For this project, I collected a public dataset from the **Correctional Service Department (CSD) of Hong Kong**. The dataset was formatted into structured data that the language model can train on, such as Question and Answer pairs.

## Fine-Tuning Process

I used the **LLaMA3** model and the **Unsloth** library to fine-tune the model. All the necessary code and explanations are available in my Google Colab notebook. [[Link to Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LSHzuMpnCppHdYW_7ii-R2pDiUMtrJxB?usp=drive_link)](#)

**Tools Used:**
- **LLaMA3**: A powerful language model for fine-tuning.
- **Unsloth**: A library to facilitate the fine-tuning process.

## Installation and Running the Model Locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finetune-llm.git
cd finetune-llm
